### Picture of the Day (Web Application)

This project entails the design and development of a web application utilizing the NASA APOD API. Users will have the capability to request Astronomy Pictures of the Day by specifying the desired date. Additionally, they will be able to save and manage their favorite pictures as favorites. The focus of this project is on creating a user-friendly interface and efficient functionality to provide users with an engaging and seamless experience in exploring astronomy imagery.

## Imagery
Imagining the APOD Web app as a playful astronaut navigating the moonâ€™s surface alongside cheerful anime characters infuses the design with a sense of wonder and joy. This approach is aimed at making the site engaging and delightful for children, encouraging exploration and curiosity about space.

- Purpose: Used solely for decoration.  
- Design Decision: Stars have no hover effect, maintaining simplicity and preventing distraction.  

**Heart:**  
- Purpose: Utilized to mark images as favorites.  
- Design Decision: Clicking on the heart icon will designate the image as a favorite, allowing users to easily access and revisit their preferred content. This functionality enhances user interaction and personalization.
